 hnco.c  -   modified HNCO experiment by Kay et al.; uses shifted
		   laminar pulses for selective inversion of the Ca
		   spins during t1; uses a broadband inversion pulse to
		   refocus the Ca-N15 and CO-N15 scalar interactions
		   during t2; uses broadband H1 decoupling during t1,
		   t2, and both tau(cn) periods; the C13 and N15 RF
		   channels are user-selectable.
