 hncoca_alt.c  -  modified HN(CO)CA 3D experiment by Ikura and Bax; uses
		    shifted lminar pulses for off-resonance excitation of
		    the CO spins; uses a broadband inversion pulse to refocus
		    the Ca-N15 and CO-N15 scalar interactions during t2; uses
		    broadband H1 decoupling during t1, t2, both tau(cn) periods,
		    and both tau(cc) periods; does not refocus the Ca-N15
		    scalar interactions during the two tau(cc) periods; the
		    C13 and N15 RF channels are user-selectable.

                        has two less 15N pulses than in hncoca.c . This may give
                     somewhat better sensitivity at the expense of less selectivity
                     (intra-residue connectivities may be seen)
