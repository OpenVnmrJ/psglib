 hnconodec.c  -   modified HNCO experiment by Kay et al.; uses shifted
		   laminar pulses for selective inversion of the Ca
		   spins during t1; uses a broadband inversion pulse to
		   refocus the Ca-N15 and CO-N15 scalar interactions
		   during t2; the C13 and N15 RF channels are user-
		   selectable.

                   no proton decoupling is used (as opposed to hnco.c)
