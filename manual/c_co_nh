  The five pulse sequences, c_co_nh.c, gc_co_nh.c, gc_co_nh2.c, gcbca_co_nh.c,
  and gcbca_co_nh2.c all utilise the same macro, "c_co_nhcal" (which needs to 
  be run only once), and the same parameter set.  The gradient parameters are
  not used in the non-gradient version of course.

  The two gradient versions for each pulse sequence are believed to give 
  equivalent results.  In one a 180 C13 pulse is replaced by a period of
  seduce decoupling.




                       INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
         
    1. Calibrate 90 degree pulse lengths for H1 (pw), C13 (pwC) and N15 (pwN)
       at the chosen power levels, tpwr, pwClvl and pwNlvl respectively.

    2. You should check, at least once, the C13 amplifier compression.  At a 
       particular pwClvl (eg 60) and dpwrf=4095, measure the C13 90 - this is
       pwC of course.  Repeat this measurement at dpwrf=2047 (add 6 to dpwr
       if you are using C13 decoupling during this measurement).  A compression
       factor, "comp" is then determined by:
                comp = (C13 90 @ dpwrf=2047) / 2.0 * pwC
       If comp is less than 0.95 serious loss of S/N may occur because the 
       amplitudes of the soft C13 pulses will not be accurately calibrated.
       Either reduce pwClvl until comp > 0.95, or set the value of the comp
       parameter provided to this compression factor. The default is comp=1.0.
       As an example, in one test, setting comp=0.85 as determined above
       reduced the loss in S/N from 30% to 3%. If comp > 0.95, a small
       advantage may result in setting comp to the measured value.

    3. The SLP pulses (shifted laminar pulses - pulses shifted off-resonance)
       must then be calculated using the macro "c_co_nhcal".  These pulses
       are stored in your shapelib and automatically called by the pulse
       sequence code.  This calculation takes into account whether the
       spectrometer is a 500, 600, or 750 system and it only needs to be done
       once for each system.  All other pulse powers and
       pulse lengths are automatically calculated from these settings within
       the pulse sequence code for 500, 600, and 750MHz systems.

    4. The two C13 180 degree pulses after the DIPSI-3 decoupling have been
       replaced by a single 6-pulse composite dubbed "shaka6" which povides
       near perfect refocusing with no phase roll over the Cab region and
       near perfect inversion over the CO region 18kHz off-resonance. 

    5. "c_co_nhcal" also sets ni=ni2=0 and phase=phase2=1 ready for a 1D 
       spectral check.  When ni=0, the calculated lengths of the SLP pulses
       (pwC4, pwC5, pwC7)  are
       displayed by dg to provide confidence to the user that everything has
       been set up properly - do not change these!  Note also that these SLP
       pulse lengths are determined only by dfrq and do not depend on pwC. 

    6. Centre H1 frequency on H2O (4.7ppm), C13 frequency on 46ppm, and N15 
       frequency on the amide region.

    7. The H1 frequency is NOT shifted to the amide region during the sequence
       as suggested in the JMR article as this appears to achieve no purpose.
       The H1 DIPSI2 decoupling was increased to 7.5 kHz to achieve better H2O
       suppression.

    8. The parameter phi7cal (listed in dg when ni=0) is provided to adjust 
       the phase of the last 90 degree C13 pulse, which is phase-shifted by
       the prior 180 degree pulse on the Ca region and by the use of SLP
       pulses on the CO region. The experimentally determined value of this
       phase is also very sensitive to small timing differences (microseconds)
       between the two theta delays.  A value of 267 degrees (or -93) has been
       found for 500 Unity Plus,  but this will change significantly
       with other systems.  Check this phase via 1D spectra - maximise signal,
       or for greater accuracy obtain the value for a null and then add or 
       subtract 90 degrees.

    9. For gradient versions,
       most gradient levels and durations require no adjustment.  The coherence
       pathway gradients gzlvl1 and gzlvl2 should be adjusted for maximum
       signal in a 1D spectrum (normally gzlvl2 is slightly less than gzlvl1).
       typical values are 15000/14850 with the duration gt1=0.0025.

   10. All echo times within the sequence have been adjusted to provide maximum
       signal for the protein alphalytic protease (mw 2?000).  These are not
       under parameter adjustment, but can be changed within the sequence code.
       To do this replace each pair in turn with d4 and maximise 1D signals with
       an array of d4.
