 cyclenoeSLP. Difference NOE experiment
      Uses the obs xmtr for irradiation
      and frequency-shifted rf (for single-frequency irradiation)
      frequency-cycled irradiation only done via offset PSG element

  Parameters:

    pw - 90 degree excitation pulse (at power tpwr)
    intsub - 'y': internal subtraction of data acquired by on-resonance
                  and off-resonance selective excitation
             'n': data acquired by on-resonance and off-resonance selec-
                  tive excitation are stored separately
    satfrq  - frequency of selective saturation (on resonance);
              (make this an array if intsub = 'n', off-res dof if cycle='n')
    control - off resonance selective saturation frequency
              (an inactive parameter if intsub = 'n')
    cycle   - cycle='y' does on-resonance saturation using frequency cycling
              around the frequency "satfrq" given by "spacing"and"pattern" 
              cycle='n' does off-resonance saturation at control
    spacing - spacing(in Hz) of multiplet
    pattern - pattern type ( 1 for singlet, 2 for doublet, etc.)    
    tau     - period spent on a single irradiation point during cycling 
    satpwr  - power of selective irradiation
    sattime - total length of irradiation at frequency satfrq.
  satshape  - name of shapelib file for saturation pulse
  conshape  - name of shapelib file for control pulse
    mix - mixing time
    hs - 'ynyn'
    sspul   - sspul='y' does trim(x)-trim(y)  before d1
    nt - intsub = 'n':  multiple of 16
         intsub = 'y':  multiple of 32


    NOTE:  This pulse sequence requires that the observe channel be
           equipped with direct synthesis RF,waveform gen. and a linear amplifier.
           satpwr ranges 0-63 control obs attenuator
