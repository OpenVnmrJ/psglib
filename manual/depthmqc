The parameter mult controls the editing e.g. mult=1 give a 90 degree
editing pulse.  With mult=1 you will get methylenes only with opposite phase
from a mult=0 spectrum. The sequence works well with mult=1 to give a
1D proton spectrum with CH2's only.
	The authors suggest editing flip angles of 60,120,and 180 degrees
to separate CH, CH2, and CH3 resonances. See paper for details.
