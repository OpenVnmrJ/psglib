Current phase cycling is taken from the J. Magn. Reson. paper.

Absolute value cosy and noesy run concurrently. 
Set nf = 2 for both to be run. If nf = 1, only the noesy will be run.
To process set cf = 1 for cosy or cf = 2 for noesy.

The parameter mixvar controls the random mix period:
	if mixvar = 0 a constant mix time results.
	if mix = ~0.06 a 6% variation will result.
EXPECT MORE T1 NOISE IF YOU USE THIS RANDOM MIX FEATURE.
The best noe data results from mixvar = 0 data.

See Magnetic Moments Vol. V, No. 2 page 6 for an interesting
alternative means or generating random delays which are constant
throughout a phase cycle and thus reduce the T1 noise.
