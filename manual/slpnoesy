 slpnoesy -  2D cross relaxation experiment WITH SLP PRESATURATION option. 
            It can be performed in
            either phase-sensitive or absolute value mode.  Either
            TPPI or the hypercomplex method can be used to achieve
            F1 quadrature in a phase-sensitive presentation.
  Added features : 1. FAD-hypercomplex
                    2. correction for d2 > 0
                    3. xmtr presaturation 

  Parameters:

       mix = mixing time.
     phase =   0: gives non-phase-sensitive experiment (P-type peaks);
                  nt(min) = multiple of 16
                  nt(max) = multiple of 64

             1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
               3: gives TPPI phase-sensitive experiment;
                  nt(min) = multiple of  8
                  nt(max) = multiple of 32

    satflg  = 'y' uses obs xmtr for presat at satfrq and satpwr
              for satdly seconds
                 set dm='n' and satflg='ynyn', for example
    satfrq  = saturation frequency for xmtr presaturation
    satpwr  = saturation power for xmtr presaturation
    satdly  = saturation period follows D1
    slpflg  = flag that turns on slp presaturation
    satshape = shape used for slp presaturation
    satshape = slpsatd (tof > satfrq)
               slpsatu (tof < satfrq)
        ss = number of steady state pulses; if ss < 0 then -ss
             steady-state transients are performed before EVERY increment;
             if ss > 0, then ss steady-state transients are performed
             before only the first increment.
     sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at start of pulse sequence
             'n': normal NOESY experiment
