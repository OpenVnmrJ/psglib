/* noesyskbx -  2D cross relaxation experiment using sklbax "read" pulse
 
   (includes : 1. FAD-hypercomplex
               2. correction for d2 > 0          )

       mix = mixing time.
     phase = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
             3 :  gives TPPI phase-sensitive experiment;
    p1ms   = soft pulse width entered as delay in ms - calibrate with
              the first increment
             (*** p1ms calibrated using the first increment with this
              sequence is generally less than that calibrated using
              sklbax sequence ***)
    softpwr = power for soft pulse
    trim   = trim pulse follows the read pulse
  phaseinc = phase increment (in degree) to compensate phase difference
             between the soft pulse (p1ms) and the hard pulse (pw)


          -------    minimum 16 scans recommended    ------
