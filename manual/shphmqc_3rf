 shphmqc_3rf- heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence with hypercomplex
         implementation, steady-state transients for either all or
         just the first t1 increment, pulse+receiver phasecycling during
         steady-state transients, proton pulses are shaped pulses
          REQUIRES WAVEFORM GENERATOR
          USES THE THIRD CHANNEL FOR X PULSES AND DECOUPLING

   Parameters:

        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
     pwx2lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; 
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition
      shape= shapelib file for shaped pulse
         tpwr= power level for shaped pulses
           pw= pulse width for both shaped pulses
      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
