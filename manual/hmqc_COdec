 hmqc_COdec- hmqc with options for decoupling of N15 and 13CO in multiply-
             labelled molecules. Needs third channel.

         uses status-controlled n15 decoupling during t1 and an SLP-180
         degree band-selective pulse on the carbonyls in t1 for decoupling.
         Must have a shapelib entry for "shape" which is frequency-shifted 
         enough from dof to be centered in the carbonyl carbon region.

         set dn2 parameters for normal decoupling conditions, using
         dm2='nyn', or 'nyy'. the pwco pulse should be long enough to be
         selective for the carbonyl region without affecting protonated
         carbons. the shapelib file should be created as an SLP pulse, for
         example convolute('gauss','softCO180',500,18000) to make a new
         shapelib file "softCO180" from an existing file "gauss" to be used
         for the pwco pulse having a length of 500us with an effective 
         excitation 18000 Hz downfield from the dof position.

   Parameters:
      sspul = 'y' does trim(x)-trim(y) before d1(recommended for hmbc)
     satmode = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yy':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
     shape  = shapelib file for SLP-carbonyl decoupling pulse
    pwcolvl = power level for carbonyl 180
      pwco  = pulse length for carbonyl 180
        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and nulling period (null)
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwxlvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
      mbond = 'n':  HMQC experiment
              'y':  HMBC experiment
      taumb = delay to allow long-range heteronuclear antiphase magnetization
              to evolve for multiple-bond correlation
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; this is mandatory if mbond='y'
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition
                      (recommended for mbond='n')

               Note:  The 1/(2j) refocusing period prior to acquisition is
                      always present, regardless of dm, unless mbond='y'

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
                3:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
              1,4:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (real F1-FT)
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus
         nt = multiple of  4 (minimum)
	      multiple of 32 (maximum for mbond='n')
              multiple of 64 (maximum for mbond='y')
	      multiple of 16 (minimum recommended for mbond='n')
              multiple of 32 (minimum recommended for mbond='y')
