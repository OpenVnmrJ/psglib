/* noesy11 -  2D cross relaxation experiment using 11echo "read" pulse
 
       mix = mixing time.
     phase = 1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
        p1 = correction of second pulse width for radiation damping
        p2 = correction of second pulse width for radiation damping
       tau = 1-1 pulse separation(typ 50-100us: try 80us)
      tau2 = times flanking 1-1 echo part  (<<1ms) (try 100us)
       hst = 40-60ms or half the mix time.Necessary to eliminate x-y H2O
             component prior to 11echo read pulse. 
        hs = nnyn or ynyn
    
     use "calfa" to set alfa for lp=0 to obtain flat baseline
