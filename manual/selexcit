   selexcit   -- selective excitation with presat option

	selective excitation is based on double PFG spin-echo
		(aka excitation sculpting)
			Shaka, et.al  JACS, 117, 4199 (1995)

	hsgpwr : homospoil gradient
	gzlvl1,gt1,gzlvl2,gt2 : echo gradients during DPFGSE
		Typical : 8000, 0.00025, 5000, .0005

	selpwr, selpw, pwshape : selective proton 180 power, pulse width, and shape - Typical : to be created by Pbox

	presaturation option is included (using satflg,satdly,satfrq and satpwr)
