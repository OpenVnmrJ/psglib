lrhetcor - long-range heteronuclear chemical shift correlation with 
              BIRD pulse during refocusing delay and a 1-step
              low-pass J filter

  include:  (1) 1-step low-pass J filter
            (2) coupled or decoupled spectrum (for coupled spectrum
                the refocusing delay is automatically eliminated)
            (3) BIRD pulse during refocusing (for decoupled spectrum)


 Parameters:

      pw  -  90 degree pulse on the observe nucleus
    tpwr  -  transmitter power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the transmitter channel
      pp  -  proton 90 degree pulse on the decoupler channel
   pplvl  -  decoupler power level; only for systems with a linear
             amplifier on the decoupler channel; otherwise decoupler
             is turned to to full-power for pulses on systems that
             have bilevel decoupling capability
     dhp  -  decoupler power level during acquisition
    dpwr  -  decoupler power level during acquisition for systems with
	     linear amplifiers
    j1xh  -  one-bond heternuclear coupling constant
    jnxh  -  multiple-bond heteronuclear coupling constant
      nt  -  multiple of 8 (minimum required)
             multiple of 32 (minimum recommended)
