/* hmqctocsy- HMQC with CLEAN-TOCSY(MLEV17) proton relay;
            supports both hypercomplex and TPPI implementations, steady-state
            transients for either all or just the first t1 increment,
            pulse+receiver phasecycling during steady-state transients, and
            presaturation using the transmitter.


   Parameters:

     window = clean-tocsy window(in us)
     satflg = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yy':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition 
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and the nulling period (null)
         p1 = 90 degree transmitter pulse length for protons (power = p1lvl)
       tpwr = power level for MLEV-16 spin lock and trim pulses 
         pw = 90 degree transmitter pulse for the MLEV-16 spin lock
     pwxlvl = dpwr level for decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
        mix = mixing time for isotropic mixing
       trim = length of trim pulse preceding the MLEV-16 spin lock
         dm = 'nny':  activates 1/(2j) refocusing period before acquisition
                for heteronuclear broadband decoupling
      phase = 1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment with F1 quadrature
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment with F1 quadrature
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus
         nt = multiple of 8
