Current phase cycling is taken from the J. Magn. Reson. paper.

Absolute value cosy and noesy run concurrently. 
Set nf = 2 for both to be run. If nf = 1, only the noesy will be run.
To process, set cf = 1 for cosy or cf = 2 for noesy.

Parameter "mixvar" only serves as a control for choosing a random delay
(mixvar != 0) or a fixed delay (mixvar == 0). DPS does not function
properly with this version.

See Magnetic Moments Vol. V, No. 2 page 6 for an accounting
of the tablib-based method of random mixtime control employed
in this version.
