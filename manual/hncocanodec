 hncocanodec.c  -  modified HN(CO)CA 3D experiment by Ikura and Bax; uses
		    shifted laminar pulses for off-resonance excitation of
		    the CO spins; uses a broadband inversion pulse to refocus
		    the Ca-N15 and CO-N15 scalar interactions during t2; uses
		    no broadband H1 decoupling during t1, t2, both tau(cn) periods,
		    and both tau(cc) periods; the C13 and N15 RF channels are
		    user-selectable.
