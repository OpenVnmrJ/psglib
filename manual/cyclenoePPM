/* cyclenoe PPM. Difference NOE experiment
                 noe difference via multiplet phase cycling using the
                 Programmable Pulse Modulator (PPM).  May be used for obs
                 xmtr irradiation and/or attenuation of selective excitation
                 and control pulses.
                 eg.: if shape = hard102.RF such that have 1/10 amplitude of
                      shape = hard.RF, then a 20 dB attenuation of a standard
                      hard pulse can be provided.
  Parameters:

    pw - 90 degree excitation pulse (at power tpwr)
    intsub - 'y': internal subtraction of data acquired by on-resonance
                  and off-resonance selective excitation
             'n': data acquired by on-resonance and off-resonance selec-
                  tive excitation are stored separately
    satfrq  - frequency of selective saturation (on resonance);
    control - off resonance selective saturation frequency
              (an inactive parameter if intsub = 'n')
    cycle   - cycle='y' does on-resonance saturation using frequency cycling
              around the frequency "satfrq" given by "spacing"and"pattern" 
    spacing - spacing(in Hz) of multiplet
    pattern - pattern type ( 1 for singlet, 2 for doublet, etc.)    
    tau     - period spent on a single irradiation point during cycling 
    satpwr  - power of selective irradiation
    sattime - total length of irradiation at frequency satfrq.
    satshape- name of shapelib file for saturation pulse
    conshape- name of shapelib file for control pulse
    mix - mixing time
    sspul   - sspul='y' does Trim(x)-Trim(y) before d1
    nt - intsub = 'n':  multiple of 16
         intsub = 'y':  multiple of 32


    NOTE:  This pulse sequence requires that the observe channel be
           equipped with direct synthesis RF and a linear amplifier.
