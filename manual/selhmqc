/* selhmqc- selective HMQC with hypercomplex and
         TPPI implementations, steady-state transients for either all or
         just the first t1 increment, pulse+receiver phasecycling during
         steady-state transients, and presaturation using the transmitter
         using the waveform generator

   Parameters:
      sspul = 'y' does trim(x)-trim(y) where trim is 200*pw (at tpwr) to
              destroy all 1H magnetization (forces steady-state)

     satflg = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yy':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
     selpwr = selective decoupler pulse power
     seltime= selective decoupler pulse length (in sec) at dof
   selshape = selective decoupler (wfg) shape
        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and nulling period (null)
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwxlvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
       jeff = effective j (longer than j to account for precession during seltime)
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; 
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition

               Note:  The 1/(2j) refocusing period prior to acquisition is
                      always present

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
                3:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
              1,4:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (real F1-FT)
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus


   Note:  The single-bond correlation experiment can be presented
          in a phase-sensitive manner simply due to the fact that
          the total time for proton-proton scalar coupling evolution
          (2*bird + d2) is quite short.
