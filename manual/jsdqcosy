               using obs xmtr for saturation
              TRANSMITTER MUST BY AT SOLVENT FREQUENCY

  Parameters:

      sspul = 'y': selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y)
               sequence at start of pulse sequence
             (highly recommended to eliminate "long T1" artifacts)
         pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
      selpw = pulse width of selective inversion pulse
     selpwr = power level for selective inversion pulse
   selshape = shapelib file for selective inversion pulse 
               (must be in shapelib as .RF file. Should be created
                via "convolute" macro to make an "SLP" pulse, allowing
                off-resonance excitation without moving frequency)
   satshape = shapelib file for saturation (can use less power than with
              just attenuators)
    satmode = 'yn' for saturation during relaxation period
              'ny' for saturation during d2
              'yy' for both
     satdly = presaturation period -uses obs xmtr at tof with satpwr; 
      phase =   0: P-type non-phase-sensitive experiment
              1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
