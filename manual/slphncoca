slphncoca.c      -  HN(CO)CA 3D experiment by Kay et al.; uses a
	   	    frequency-shifted pulse on the Ca spins;
                  Krish - Nov. 27 1991
                          NOTE : decoupler = N15
                                 decoupler2= C13
                  uses only FAD in F1 and F2
           (SLP presaturation included )
   Parameters:

      sspul = 'y':  selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y) sequence at the start
		    of the pulse sequence
     satflg = 'y':  H1 presaturation during relaxtion delay
     satfrq = frequency of 1H presaturation for all periods
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
     slpflg = 'y' : off-resonance presaturation with slp
     satshape = slpsatd (tof is downfield to water)
                slpsatu (tof is upfield to water)
     h2off = water off-resonance frequency (tof - satfrq)
     mult = multiplication factor shape_pw calculation (should be 10 for the two
             shapes noted above)
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
       tpwr = power level for 1H transmitter pulses
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
       dof2 = should be set to C0 frequency
    pwcalvl = power level for Ca decoupler pulses
       pwca = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for Ca at `pwcalvl`
    cashape = frequency-shifted pulse for Ca excitation
    pwcolvl = power level for C0 decoupler pulses
       pwco = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for C0 at `pwcolvl`
   pwco2lvl = power level for shorter CO pulse
      pwco2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for C0 at `pwco2lvl`
   pwn15lvl = power level for N15 decoupler pulses
      pwn15 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for N15
       dpwr = power level for N15 broadband decoupling
       tau1 = first delay in sequence (NH scalar coupling)
       tau2 = second delay in sequence
       tau3 = third delay in sequence
       tau4 = fourth delay in sequence
         dm = 'nnnnn':  no broadband decoupling of N15 during acquisition
              'nnnny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling of N15
		        during acquisition
        dm2 = 'n':  no broadband decoupling of C13 during acquisition

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
     phase2 = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F2 quadrature (complex F2-FT)

   NOTE:  This sequence is same as HNCOCA except for the slp presaturation
          option.   Delays and shapes for pulses are the same as in HNCOCA
