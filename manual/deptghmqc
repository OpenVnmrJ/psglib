 deptghmqc - Pulsed Field Gradient DEPT-HMQC
		phase sensitive version

	Processing:   wft2d(1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1)
			rp and lp same as in s2pul spectrum

	Recommendations:
	  (small molecule in H2O)
		13C:    gzlvl1 = 10000
			gt1    = 0.001
			gzlvl3 = 5025
			gt3    = 0.001
			gstab  = 0.0005
			hsgpwr = 10000
			hsgt   = 0.005
			nt = 1 per inc (FAD'ed axials, though
					substantially reduced)
			     2 per inc (No significant axials or
					FAD'ed axials even with 
					high concentration samples
					-  recommended)
			     4 per inc (more improvement in axial
					suppression)

		Modification - (i) Two gt1's preceed and follow d2,
				   instead of follow and 
				   preceed X 90's. 
			      (ii) TANGO pulse followed by a 
				   homospoil gradient preceed 
				   the actual sequence
			     (iii) sspul option included
			      (iv) FAD on both first X 90 and
				   first X 180
			       (v) Two step phase cycling on X 90's
