####### 	or single frequency F1 experiments supported #################
##################### WAVEFORM GENERATOR NEEDED for this version################

	If pwxs = 0, a normal hard pulsed hmqc/hmbc functionally
	identical to hmqc.c will be run.

	pwxs != 0 selects a MQ [13C] reconversion pulse of type 'shape'
	for duration pwxs (in micro sec) at power pwxslvl followed
	by the delay refoc (in micro seconds); refoc is not calculated
	but must be entered manually.

	Unique Parameters:
		pwxs = 6000 with pwxslvl = 34 (B2=630Hz) are the
		default for shape = 'eburp'
		If pwxs != 0 the first 1/2 of evolution is lengthened
		by 1/2 pwxs. 
		refoc is the final refocusing delay and is dependent
		upon the shape.
		refoc = 1/2j for eburp in hmqc, ~1/2pwxs longer for gaussian.	
		refoc = 100 for hmBc with eburp.

	Unless a 13C acquired on the same sample in the same instrument
	is available, avoid the temptation to employ softer pulses than
	the default (6000 us eburp). Use (your edited) setdof macro to
	set dof positions. The hmqcf1 macro is superb for defining windows
	in 2D experiments. You should edit the $dofzero variable in this
	supplied macro to reflect your current instruments.
