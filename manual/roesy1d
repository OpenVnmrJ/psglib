/* roesy1d - one dimensional rotating frame NOE experiment;
             a continuous-wave spin lock is employed;
             compensation for off-resonance effects may be performed.

   ref:      H. Kessler, U. Anders, G. Gemmecker and S. Steuernagel
             J. Magn. Reson. 85, 1-14 (1989). 

  Parameters:
        p1 = 90 degree pulse on protons (power level at "p1lvl")
     p1lvl = power level for the p1 pulse 
      tpwr = power level for the spin lock pulse
       mix = mixing time
        ss = number of steady state pulses
     sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) sequence at start
    rocomp = 'n': no resonance offset compensation
             'y': resonance offset compensation
    satdly = length of saturation (at power satpwr); if
    selpwr = transmitter power for the shaped pulse
     selpw = 90 degree shape pulse in microseconds
  selshape = shape of the shaped pulse
    selfrq = transmitter frequency for selective excitation
    satpwr = power for presaturation
    satfrq = frequency for presaturation
    satmode = 'y': selects  presaturation
             'n': no presaturation
     purge = 'y': selects compensating purging pulse
             'n': purging pulse is bypassed
        nt = min:  multiple of 8 
             max:  multiple of 16   (recommended)
