 refhsq.c      -  heteronuclear Overbodenhausen experiment using
                  partially modified refocused INEPT and broadband
                  decoupling of H1 during t1; phasecycled the H1
	          purge pulse; this sequence has RF duality.


   Parameters:

      sspul = 'y':  selects for Trim(x)-Trim(y) sequence at the start
		    of the pulse sequence
              'n':  normal experiment
        fad = 'y':  TPPI axial-peak displacement
              'n':  standard phasecycle
      f1180 = 'y':  the first t1 point is sampled at half the t1 dwell time
              'n':  the first t1 point is sampled at t1 = 0
     satflg = 'y':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'n':  no presaturation during relaxation period (satdly)
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
       tpwr = power level for H1 transmitter pulses
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
    hdshape = H1 programmable decoupling shape
      hdpwr = power level for H1 programmable decoupling
       hd90 = 90 degree pulse length for H1 programmable decoupling shape
              at power level 'hdpwr'
      hdres = tip-angle resolution for the H1 programmable decoupling
              shape
     pwxlvl = power level for X decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for X
     xrfdev = RF device for the X heteronucleus
        jxh = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant to X (in Hz)
    deltaxh = 1/(4*jxh) if deltaxh = 0.0; otherwise, the entered value is
              used; one of the delays used in the refocussed INEPT
              subsequences
      tauxh = 0.8/(4*jxh) if tauxh = 0.0; otherwise, the entered value is
              used; the other delay used in the refocussed INEPT
              subsequences
    dm(dm2) = 'nnnnn':  no broadband decoupling of X during acquisition
              'nnnny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling of X during
		        acquisition

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
