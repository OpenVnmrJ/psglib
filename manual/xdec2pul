 xdec2pul  

Two-pulse sequence in "reverse" configuration 
               Uses H1 decoupler as observse and BB transmitter as decoupler
 

	Parameters:
   	dn,dof 	used to set proton (observe) freq
	pw	90 degree pulse for protons
	dpwr	pulse power for H1 pulse
	tn,tof	used to set X nucleus freq
	tpwr	power level for X nucleus pulse
	xdec    two states, yn gives  X nucleus decoupling 
		during D1 for NOE studies
                ny gives decoupling during acquisition
                n gives coupled spectrum

Allways set dmm='n' before running the pulse sequence.  If dm is  
not set to 'n' the pulse sequence aborts.  Altering the pulse sequence so
that dm is used may result in probe damage if the first state of dm is set
to 'y'.
