   Parameters:

     satflg = 'ynnnn': presaturation during relaxation period (satdly)
              'ynyyn': presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly),
                       d3,and mix periods 
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the  relaxation delay
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwx2lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
