/* hmqcnoesy.c - 
        supports both hypercomplex (Bax mode with shifted axial peaks) 
	and TPPI implementations, steady-state
        transients for either all or just the first t1 increment,
        pulse+receiver phasecycling during steady-state transients, and
        presaturation using the transmitter.

   Parameters:

     satflg = 'ynn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yyn':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
              'yyy':  presaturation during relaxation,null and mix time
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition 
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and nulling period (null)
         pw = 90 degree transmitter pulse length for protons (power = TPWR)
     pwxlvl = dpwr level for decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
         dm = 'nny':  activates 1/(2j) refocusing period before acquisition
              and includes heteronuclear broadband decoupling
                       (recommended)
      phase = 1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment with F1 quadrature
			(using axial shifting phase cycling of Bax);
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment with F1 quadrature
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus
         nt = multiple of 8
	mix = mixing time 

Program aborts if:
	at >= 250 msec
	Duty cycle > 20%
	dm = 'yyy','yny','nyy','yyn',. . .*/
