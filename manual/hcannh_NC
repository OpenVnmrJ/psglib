 hcannh_NC  -

	relayed Ha-->Ca-->N-->Hn 4D experiment with CT t2 and t3

	selectable.

   Recommended Values:  (MW = 16 kD)

	  jca = 140 Hz
	tauch = 3.57 ms

     coshape should be created as an SLP pulse to execute a 90 degree pulse
     on the carbonyl carbon region while the 13C xmtr is centered in the
     alpha carbon region (at dof). Use the convolute macro, e.g.

           convolute('275hard','co90',55,18000)

     were 275hard is a shapelib file of 275 identical steps of 0.0 1023
     and 55 is the pulsewidth (using 275 0.2us steps)
