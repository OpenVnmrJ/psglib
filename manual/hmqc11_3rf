 hmqc11_3rf- heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence with hypercomplex
         implementation, steady-state transients for either all or
         just the first t1 increment, pulse+receiver phasecycling during
         steady-state transients, proton pulses are 11echo pulses

          USES THE THIRD CHANNEL FOR X PULSES AND DECOUPLING

   ref: Summers et al., j. amer. chem. soc. 108:4285-4294 (1986)


   Parameters:

        dof2 = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwx2lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
      tau =  1-1 echo delay
      sspul = 'y' for destroying all 1H magnetization before d1
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; 
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
