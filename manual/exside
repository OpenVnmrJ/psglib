exside - Excitation Sculptured Indirect Detection Experiment
		J-scaling option

	processing : wft2d(1,0,1,0,0,-1,0,1)
		rp = rp(s2pul) - 90
		rp1 = 0


	hsgpwr, hsgt : homospoil gradients : typical: 10000, .001
	gzlvl1,gt1,gzlvl2,gt2 : echo gradients during DPFGSE
		Typical : 8000, 0.00025, 5000, .0005
	gzlvl3,gt3,gzlvl4,gt4 : coherence selection gradients
		Typical (for carbon) : 20000,.001,10000,.0005
	selpwr, selpw, pwshape : selective proton 180 power, pulse width, and shape - Typical : to be created by Pbox and tested using the selexcit sequence.
	jscale : jscaling factor - Depends on the T2*.  For organics it can be as large as 15, but for large molecules 3-5 is recommended
	nullflg : Tango nulling of C13-H to suppress one bond correlations. - can be turned off if the "selection" does not cover 13C satellites of any other proton resonances.  Recommended nullflg='y'.

	jnxh = long range coupling constant for optimizing the PT and refoc delays.
	j1xh = one bond coupling constant for the TANGO
	
	IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU FIRST USE THE SELEXCIT SEQUENCE/MACRO TO MAKE SURE YOUR "SELECTIONS" WORK AND USE THOSE PARAMETERS TO SETUP THE EXSIDE EXPERIMENT.   THE EXSIDE MACRO WILL USE THE DPFGSE PARAMETERS FROM THE SELEXCIT EXPERIMENT.

	SELEXCIT IS IN THE USERLIB.
