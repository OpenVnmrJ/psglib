 wnoesy -    NOESY wherein each pulse may be individually adjusted
             for power and shape. Useful for selective NOESY (allowing
             reduction of sw1 and ni). Use lsfrq1 to move folded peaks
             in F1( although rf selective p1 pulse is centered away from
             tof, the precession frequencies during t1 are still with respect
             to tof. Thus, depending on the choice of the SLP p1 pulse and
             the value of sw1, the amount of folding or shifting in F1 will
             vary. Just determine the amount of needed shift and enter an
             appropriate value for lsfrq1 before doing the 2D transform).

                     p1,p2 and p3 use wfg shaped pulses
                     p1 pulse is SLP(shifted laminar pulse) to provide
                     a 90 degree pulse in region of interest. A shapelib.RF
                     file "p1shape" must be created prior to use
                     via the "convolute" macro. The rf carrier is always
                     centered on the water at "tof".

  Parameters:

       mix = mixing time.
     phase =   0: gives non-phase-sensitive experiment (P-type peaks);
                  nt(min) = multiple of 16
                  nt(max) = multiple of 64

             1,2: gives HYPERCOMPLEX phase-sensitive experiment;
               3: gives TPPI phase-sensitive experiment;
                  nt(min) = multiple of  8
                  nt(max) = multiple of 32

    satmode= 'y' uses obs xmtr at power satpwr and tof
              satmode='yyyn', for example to saturate during satdly,d2 and mix
    satdly = length of presaturation period;
    p1pwr  = power level for first(tophat) pulse using shape "p1shape"
    p2pwr  = power level for second pulse using shape "p2shape"
    p3pwr  = power level for third pulse using shape "p3shape"
   satpwr  = saturation power level
