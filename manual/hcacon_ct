 hcacon_ct       -  HCA(CO)N 3D experiment by Fairbrother et al.; uses a
	   	    frequency-shifted pulse on the CO spins
                    with modifications to allow 1H 180 to cross CO 90 
                    at long t1 times
                    Constant time version of hcacon
                    sw1, ni and phase for Ca (t1)
                    sw2, ni2 and phase2 for 15N (t2)
   Parameters:

		    of the pulse sequence
      f1180 = 'n':  standard t1 timing
              'y':  modified t1 timing for t1(1) = half the dwell time
      f2180 = 'n':  standard t2 timing

     satmode = 'y':  H1 presaturation during relaxtion delay
     satfrq = frequency of 1H presaturation for all periods
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
       tpwr = power level for 1H transmitter pulses
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
   pwc13lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
      pwc13 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length  `pwc13lvl`
   pwn15lvl = power level for N15 decoupler pulses
      pwn15 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for N15
       dpwr = power level for C13 broadband decoupling
        dof = decoupler frequency ( should be centered on alpha carbon region)
        jch = CH scalar coupling- used to calculate tau delay
       Del1 = second delay in sequence
       Del2 = third delay in sequence
        del = little delta delay
          ConstT =  constant time delay
    coshape = SLP pulse of 0 phase for off resonance CO
   cshape1 = SLP pulse of Ca phase 1 CO phase 0
   cshape2 = SLP pulse of Ca phase 1 CO phase 2
   cshape3 = SLP pulse Ca phase 0 CO phase 0, but lower power for Ca
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of C13 during acquisition
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling of C13
		        during acquisition
        dm2 = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of N15 during acquisition

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
     phase2 = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F2 quadrature (complex F2-FT)

          this shapelib.RF file should be created by 

           convolute('275hard','co90',pwc13,125*dfrq)

          where 275hard.RF is a shapelib file consisting of 275 lines
          in the format   0.0  1023.0   . pwc13lvl should be chosen
          such that pwc13 is close to 55us. 125*dfrq is the approx.
          offset of the carbonyl region from the alfa region.
          (275 lines is chosen so that 275*0.2=55us.[0.2 is the
           waveform generator timebase.])

          these shapelib.RF files should be created by

           convolutep('275hard','caco1',55,0,90,125*dfrq,0)
           convolutep('275hard','caco2',55,0,90,125*dfrq,180)

      cshape3:

          this shapelib.RF files should be created by

           first, making a '550hard.RF' file(550 lines of 0.0  1023.0)
           then,
              convolute('275hard','temp',55*2,125*dfrq)
              addshapes('temp',1,0,'550hard',0.5,0,'twolvl')
