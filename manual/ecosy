PW = 90 degree pulse on the observed nucleus
D1 = relaxation delay  (1-3*T1)
D2 = evolution time (t1 period)
AT = acquisition time (t2 period)
SW = spectral width (usually SW1 = SW, except for PHASE = 3)
NI = number of t1 increments (set so that SW1/NI = 12)
NT = multiple of 32 (MINIMUM)
     multiple of 192 (optimum)
PHASE = 1,2 hypercomplex (States-Haberkorn)
	phase-sensitive acquisition with FAD (f1 axial displacement,
	shifting f1 axial peaks to the edge of the spectrum).

SSPUL = 'y':  activates a homospoil-90-homospoil sequence which
              precedes D1; used to achieve a less oscillatory
              steady-state for 2D experiments where the recycle
              time is shorter than T1.

SS = number of steady-state transients;  if ss < 0, then -ss
     transients (with phasecycling of pulses and receiver) are
     performed before EACH experiment in either an arrayed or 2D
     experiment; if ss > 0, then ss transients are performed before
     only the first experiment in such cases.

SATMODE= 'y' : transmitter presaturation during SATDLY
               requires linear amplifiers on observe channel.
         'n' : no transmitter presaturation during SATDLY
SATDLY = transmitter presaturation period
         is NOT part of D1 
SATPWR = power level for transmitter presaturation
SATFRQ = frequency for transmitter presaturation
