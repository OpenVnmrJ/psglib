#########DEPT-HMQC TOCSY Inverse heteronuc. correlation with DEPT-editting#####

	Adapted from depthmqc Kessler et al JMR 85,400 (1989)
TOCSY step preceeds data acquisition

The parameter mult controls the editting e.g. mult=1 give a 90 degree
editting pulse.  With mult=1 you will get methylenes only with opposite phase
from a mult=0 spectrum. The sequence works well with mult=1 to give a
1D proton spectrum with CH2's only.
	The authors suggest editting flip angles of 60,120,and 180 degrees
to separate CH, CH2, and CH3 resonances. See paper for details.
	The parameter multc serves to edit the direct responses
		multc=1 and dm='nnnnn' with multh=2 should result in
		a 2D spectrum with only tocsy peaks with phase controlled
		by the dept portion
