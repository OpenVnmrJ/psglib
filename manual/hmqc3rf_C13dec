 hmqc3rf_C13dec- heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence with hypercomplex and
         TPPI implementations, steady-state transients for either all or
         just the first t1 increment, pulse+receiver phasecycling during
         steady-state transients, and presaturation using the transmitter.

      permits C13 decoupling during t1 by status control on carbonyls and
      slp-180 degree pulse on alpha carbons. A file must exist in shapelib
      to do the alpha 180. Use "convolute" to make this file, for example:

        convolute('120hard','c13dec',24,-18000), where 120 hard is a shapelib
        file that is 120 lines of 0.0  1023.0 (5 steps per microsec x 24 us =
        120 steps). 'c13dec' is the name of the shifted frequency pulse used
        by the simshaped_pulse statement, and -18000 is the effective frequency
        shift of the pulse.

   Parameters:

     satmode = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yy':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
     pwca   = Calpha decoupling 180 degree pulse
     pwcalvl= Calpha decoupling power level
     shape  = shapelib entry for SLP-Ca pulse shape
        dof2 = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
        dof  = set in the CO region of spectrum
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and nulling period (null)
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwx2lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
      mbond = 'n':  HMQC experiment
              'y':  HMBC experiment
      taumb = delay to allow long-range heteronuclear antiphase magnetization
              to evolve for multiple-bond correlation
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; this is mandatory if mbond='y'
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition
                      (recommended for mbond='n')

               Note:  The 1/(2j) refocusing period prior to acquisition is
                      always present, regardless of dm, unless mbond='y'

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
                3:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
              1,4:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (real F1-FT)
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus
         nt = multiple of  4 (minimum)
	      multiple of 32 (maximum for mbond='n')
              multiple of 64 (maximum for mbond='y')
	      multiple of 16 (minimum recommended for mbond='n')
              multiple of 32 (minimum recommended for mbond='y')
