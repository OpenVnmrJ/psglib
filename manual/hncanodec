 hncanodec.c  -  modified HNCA experiment by Kay et al.; uses shifted
		  laminar pulses to selectively excite the Ca spins
		  while on resonance with the CO spins; on-resonance
		  selective decoupling of the CO spins is employed during
		  tau(cn) and t1; refocusing of the Ca and CO spins is
		  used during t2; this sequence has RF duality.

                       no proton decoupling is used(as in hnca.c)
