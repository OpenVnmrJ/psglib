1D steady-state X{1H} or 1H{X} NOE experiment

Parameters:

                pw:   observe pw90
                d1:   relaxation delay
                d2:   saturation pulse
                d3:   delay between saturation and observe pulse (both pulses
                      must go through high band amp in the case of F19{H1} or
		      H1{F19} )
                dpwr: heteronuclear saturation power level
                dof:  saturation irradiation

Works on UNITY INOVA with VNMR 6.1C or VNMR 6.1B (earlier versions may be
fine, but have not been tested). 
Only 1 high band amplifier is necessary. Special filters may be required for 
broadband decoupling in the case of F19{H1} or H1{F19}.
