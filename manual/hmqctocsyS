##### HMQCTOCSY  with options to null or invert the direct responses #####
#######Selective 1D or 2D F1 region selected experiments also supported#####

	p1 is the 90 degree pulse during the clean-tocsy period.
	p1lvl is the power level for pulse p1.
	window is the off-time for clean-tocsy. p1=25 window=50 (us) typical.
	
	pwxs both the soft pulse duration (in us) eg 6000 and the control
	flag. If pwxs = 0 then a normal hard pulsed experiment is done.
	pwxslvl the power for pwxs with the pulse defined in shape.
	pwxs <>0 requires manual setting of a refocussing delay refoc (in
	usec)

	Selective shape default is EBURP with pwxs = 6000

	pw is the 1H 90 during the pulse sequence outside of the mlev period.
	tpwr is the power level for pw.

	mix + trim are the isotropic mixing period, .020 and .002 are typical.

	The parameter mult controls the direct responses:
	*	mult = 0 gives a normal hmqctocsy (direct & relayed inphase).
	*	mult = 1 nulls the direct responses. dm='nnnn' best for this !
	*	mult = 2 inverts the direct responses.
    Remember dps to check things before go !!

	The d1 delay is preceded by a pair of sstrim pulses on X and Y.
	sstrim = 1000 is the default. This pulse is applied at 4dB below
	tpwr.
