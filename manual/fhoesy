Two dimensional, F19-detected proton fluorine NOE experiment

                pw:  19F pw90
                p1:  19F pw180
                d1:  relaxation delay
                d2:  evolution delay
                pwx: 1H pw90
                pwxlvl: H1 (channel 2) power level
                mix:  NOESY mixing time

Works with VNMR 6.1C and 6.1B (ealier versions untested but probably okay)

Gradient at the start of mixing time to destroy any transverse 
magnetization.  The experiment will work fine without gradient.

UNITY INOVA with 1 high band amp will work
Need special filters for broadband decoupling
