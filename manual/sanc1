n: the number of composite pulses to be executed,
   if n=0,a simple observe pulse(pw=p1/2) is executed
   if n=1,a single comp pulse with offset f1 is executed followed by an obs pw
   if n=even, n pulses are executed with f1&f2 being looped (n/2) times
      followed by the pi/2 observe pulse
   if n=odd not 1,an extra comp pulse with offset f1 is added to  the 
      (n-1) even case followed by the observe pulse  
p1:the length of the individual composite pulses;***set p1=2*pw/n***
pw:the observe pulse
d1:relaxation delay
d2:optional evolution delay
to:desired offset from resonance frequency,tof
f1:odd pulse offset (pulse 1,3,5...) calculated:f1=(to+tof)>0,if tof=0
f2:even pulse offset(pulse 2,4,6,8....)calculated:f2=(tof-to)<0,if tof=0*/
