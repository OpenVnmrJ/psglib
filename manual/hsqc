 hsqc  -  heteronuclear Overbodenhausen experiment using REVINEPT


   Parameters:

      sspul = 'y':  selects for sstrim(x)-sstrim(y) sequence at the start
		    of the pulse sequence
              'n':  normal experiment
        fad = 'y':  TPPI axial-peak displacement
              'n':  standard phasecycle
      f1180 = 'y':  the first t1 point is sampled at half the t1 dwell time
              'n':  the first t1 point is sampled at t1 = 0
     satmode = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'nn':  no presaturation during relaxation period (satdly)
	      'ny':  presaturation during only the null period
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
       null = delay associated with the BIRD nulling
       tpwr = power level for 1H transmitter pulses
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwxlvl = power level for X decoupler pulses
        pwx = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for X
     xrfdev = RF device for the X heteronucleus(2 for 1st dec., 3 for 2nd dec.)
        jxh = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant to X (in Hz)
    deltaxh = 1/(4*jxh) if jxh = 0.0; otherwise, the entered value is
              used; the delay used in the REVINEPT subsequences
    dm(dm2) = 'nnnnn':  no broadband decoupling of X during acquisition
              'nnnny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling of X during
		        acquisition


      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
