  Parameters:

         pw = 90 excitation pulse (at power level tpwr)
      phase =   0: P-type non-phase-sensitive experiment
              1,2: hypercomplex phase-sensitive experiment
                3: TPPI phase-sensitive experiment
     satflg = 'y' uses obs xmtr for presat at satfrq and satpwr for 
              satdly seconds
     satfrq = saturation frequency for xmtr presaturation
              (used only if different from tof)
     satpwr = saturation power for xmtr presaturation
     satdly = saturation period follows D1
     slpflg = flag that turns on slp presaturation
    satshape= shape used for slp presaturation
               slpsatd (tof > satfrq)
               slpsatu (tof < satfrq)
         ss = number of steady state pulses; if ss < 0 then -ss
              steady-state transients are performed before EVERY increment;
              if ss > 0, then ss steady-state transients are performed
              before only the first increment.
      sspul = 'y': selects for trim(x)-trim(y) at start of pulse sequence
              'n': normal D1 delay

         nt = min:  multiple of 16 (phase=0)
                    multiple of 8  (phase=1,2  phase=3)
              max:  multiple of 64 (phase=0)
                    multiple of 32 (phase=1,2  phase=3)


  NOTE:  If phase = 3, remember that sw1 must be set to twice the
         desired value.  The 4-january revision included the following
         sequence at the beginning of the pulse sequence:  homospoil -
         90 degree pulse - homospoil.  This should eliminate both the
         DQ-like artifacts in the 2D spectrum and the oscillatory nature
         of the steady-state.  This inclusion is selected if sspul='y'.
