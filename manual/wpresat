               d1...satdly...p1...d2(sat. opt.)...pw....at......

	two-pulse sequence with WFG control of satdly(s) and pulses 

   satfrq = frequency for saturation
    p1frq = frequency for p1 pulse
      tof = frequency for pw pulse
    p1pwr = power level for p1 pulse
    pwpwr = power level for pw pulse
   satpwr = power level for saturation pulse(s)
  p1shape = 'name'   (file found in shapelib)
  pwshape = 'name'   (file found in shapelib)
 satshape = 'name'   (file found in shapelib) 
 satmode  = determines when saturation occurs. Use as "dm" in s2pul

     SLP (convoluted waveforms may be used as shapes to do off-resonance
          excitations for p1 and/or pw without having to set p1frq <> tof)
