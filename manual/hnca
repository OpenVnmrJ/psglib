 hnca.c  -  modified HNCA experiment by Kay et al.; uses shifted
		  laminar pulses to center the "hard" Ca excitation on
		  the Ca spins while on resonance with the CO spins; uses
		  selective decoupling of the CO spins during all periods
		  of transverse N15 magnetization except t2 (N15 evolution
		  time); uses a broadband inversion pulse at the center
		  of t2 to refocus C13-N15 scalar interactions during this
		  time period; H1 broadband decoupling is used during
		  both tau(cn) periods, t1, and t2; on-resonance composite
		  180 on C13 is centered on the Ca spins using cafrq; the
		  N15 RF and C13 RF channesl are user-selectable.
