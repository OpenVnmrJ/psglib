wlexch - 2D pulsesequence to obtain exchange spectra by the 
method of Bluemich & Spiess.  This version is for
quadrupolar nuclei.

special parameters -
 magic - pulsewidth (usec) for "magic angle" pulse
 mix   - mix time (sec)
 sw1   - sw in F1 dimension. Set to the same as sw to give symmetric 2D
 phase - phase=1,2 to give both cosine and sine data, as normal
 tau1  - echo tau (usec) as for ssecho
 tau2  - echo tau (usec) as for ssecho
Use dps to view sequence.

Setup by running ssecho and optimizing everything. Then use this 
pw, tau1 tau2 and sw for wlexch.

Processing is not entirely straightforward. Use wft2d(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,xxx)
where xxx is less than 1. You will have to experiment, start with 0.75 .
The macros provided are for processing this data. They give a flavor
of the requirements. NOTE that 
they require preset vales, including a dconi display saved with s2.
The macros are simply the normal commands prefixed with sp
