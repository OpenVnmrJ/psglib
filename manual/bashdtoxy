bashdtoxy -  BAnd-Selected Homonuclear Decoupled TOCSY 
            Rance type Sensitivity enhanced

	Band selection is based on double PFG spin echo


     homodec = 'y'
	wft2d(1,0,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,0,-1,-1,0,0,-1,1,0)
		small non-zero rp1 and lp1 is expected

     homodec = 'n'
        wft2d(1,0,0,1,-1,0,0,1,0,1,-1,0,0,1,1,0)
		rp1=180 lp1=0

        hsgpwr : homospoil gradient
        gzlvl1,gt1,gzlvl2,gt2 : echo gradients during DPFGSE
                Typical : 8000, 0.00025, 5000, .0005

        selpwr, selpw, pwshape : selective proton 180 power, pulse width, and shape - Typical : to be created by Pbox

        presaturation option is included (using satflg,satdly,satfrq and satpwr)

	By default mlev17c spin lock;  Dipsi2 spinlock is turned on with dipsiflg flag
	slmix,slpwr,slpw - spinlock mixing time, power, and pw90
	homodec = flag turn on or off the F1 homonuclear decoupling
	fadflg = turn on FAD in F1.   

	Ideally, to keep the axials in the middle or the edge, sw1 should be set to integral multiple of tof-cbs (where cbs is the center of the band selection).  If sw1 is odd multiple of tof-cbs, set lsfrq1=sw1/2 and set fadflg='n'.  If sw1 is even multiple of tof-cbs set lsfrq1=0 and set fadflg='y'.

	Use selexcit experiment to set DPFGSE parameters and check band-selection.

	selexcit is a separate userlib submission
