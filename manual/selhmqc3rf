   Parameters:

     satflg = 'yn':  presaturation during relaxation period (satdly) with xmtr
              'yy':  presaturation during both relaxation period (satdly)
                     and null period (null) with xmtr
     satfrq = presaturation frequency
     satdly = saturation time during the relaxation period
     satpwr = saturation power for all periods of presaturation with xmtr
     selfrq = selective decoupler frequency
     selpwr = selective decoupler pulse power
     seltime= selective decoupler pulse length (in sec)
               (does hard pwx2 pulse if zero)
     birdeff= effective bird delay before shaped decoupler pulse
   selshape = selective decoupler (wfg) shape
        dof = frequency for decoupling during acquisition
         hs = 'yn':  homospoil pulse (hst) during the d1 relaxation delay
              'yy':  homospoil pulse during both d1 and nulling period (null)
         pw = 90 degree xmtr pulse length for protons (the observed nucleus)
     pwx2lvl = power level for decoupler pulses
        pwx2 = 90 degree decoupler pulse length for the heteronucleus
          j = one-bond heteronuclear coupling constant (in Hz)
      mbond = 'n':  HMQC experiment
              'y':  HMBC experiment
      taumb = delay to allow long-range heteronuclear antiphase magnetization
              to evolve for multiple-bond correlation
         dm = 'nnn':  no broadband decoupling of heteronucleus during
                      acquisition; this is mandatory if mbond='y'
              'nny':  broadband heteronuclear decoupling during acquisition
                      (recommended for mbond='n')

               Note:  The 1/(2j) refocusing period prior to acquisition is
                      always present, regardless of dm, unless mbond='y'

      phase = 1,2:  hypercomplex experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
                3:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (complex F1-FT)
              1,4:  TPPI experiment with F1 quadrature (real F1-FT)
       null = nulling time for protons not attached to observed heteronucleus
         nt = multiple of  4 (minimum)
	      multiple of 32 (maximum for mbond='n')
              multiple of 64 (maximum for mbond='y')
	      multiple of 16 (minimum recommended for mbond='n')
              multiple of 32 (minimum recommended for mbond='y')


   Note:  The single-bond correlation experiment can be presented
          in a phase-sensitive manner simply due to the fact that
          the total time for proton-proton scalar coupling evolution
          (2*bird + d2) is quite short.  The multiple-bond correla-
          tion experiment requires an absolute value display in F2
          but not in F1.
