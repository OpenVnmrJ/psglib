/* noesyjr45 -  2D cross relaxation experiment using jr "read" pulse
 
         Normal noesy parameters are used
      Only States method used for phase-sensitive in F1 (no tppi) 

      p1 = correction of second pulse width for radiation damping
      jrdelay = interpulse delay in jr read pulse (try 140us) 
     (use "calfa" to set alfa for lp=0 to obtain flat baseline)
