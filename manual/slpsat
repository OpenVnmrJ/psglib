 slpsat - standard two pulse sequence with optional composite
            observe pulse and SLP presaturation with xmtr

         d1 - satdly - p1 - d2 - pw - at

   satflg = 'y' : obs xmtr saturation at satfrq with power satpwr
          = 'n' : dec saturation at dof with power dpwr
   composit = 'y' : uses composite 90 for pw
            = 'n' : uses normal 90 for pw   
   slpflg = 'y' : slp presaturation 
   shape_pw = length of the individual shaped_pulse element
                (calculated from h2off)
   h2off  = water off-resonance frequency (typically tof - satfrq)
   satshape = shape of the shaped_pulse element (use slpsatd or slpsatu)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                satshape = slpsatd (positive h2off)
                           slpsatu (negative h2off)
           slpsatd is a 72 step hard pulse shape with the phase of
           one element differs from the previous one by -50 degrees
           slpsatu is a 72 step hard pulse shape with the phase of
           one element differs from the previous one by +50 degrees

           slpsatu.RF and slpsatd.RF must exist in the shapelib


   HINT :  After setting the h2off and satshape array tof (typically
           +/- 10 Hz from satfrq+h2off) to find the best suppression.
           This is to compensate for the "round-off" errors in the 
           shape_pw calculation.
